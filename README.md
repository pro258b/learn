# My Bitcoin/Crypto Risks

## Portfolio Diversity

This is almost a false concept - so far the most diversifield and robust network is Bitcoin, if it fails - it's unlikely a good news for its' competitors or 'next bitcoin'

That said, I will have small exposures to (mostly non-EVM) some potentially interesting things such as:
Ton - because of Telegram - the largest eco-system
UNI - argubly the most used infrastructure in 'crypto'
lightening network/cashu/fedimint - these are networks, not tokens

some airdrop projects - to have some fun in gambling, such as POLYMARKET


## Risk
1. traffic incident
2. dated wallet (for example sollet) with internal leaking
3. hardware recovering failure - because of not validating a backup
4. address format too old, or used bitcoin address - not quantum safe
5. hardware wallet compromising
6. flood
7. price risk (hedge through option?)

## Mitigation

I have been involving people of vastly different age group (from teens to 50s), trying to get them more engaged. A few did start to read, or use fiat to convert a little bit, but almost none of them are willing to do self-custody.
Teens are mostly not interested in boring 'bitcoin' or 'crypto'
Therefore they won't be good guardians

## to design a action plan, we need below principle:

What would someone need to recover your assets?
What's the minimum viable knowledge they'd need?
How can we make this foolproof?

## action plan

Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. Security Audit & Updates

 Review all wallet software versions, migrate from any dated wallets (especially Sollet)
 Test all hardware wallet backups with small amounts first
 Document wallet addresses and verify they use modern formats (native SegWit or Taproot)
 Create encrypted digital backups of seed phrases using Shamir's Secret Sharing

2. Physical Security

 Purchase fireproof/waterproof safe or capsule for seed storage
 Identify 2-3 geographically distributed backup locations (safety deposit boxes, trusted locations)
 Create laminated backup cards with recovery instructions
 Consider metal seed phrase backup (steel plates/capsules)

Medium-term Actions (3-6 Months)
3. Multi-signature Setup

 Implement 2-of-3 multisig for majority holdings (you + 2 trusted entities/devices)
 Test recovery process quarterly with small test transactions
 Document the complete recovery process in simple language
 Store one key with legal/professional trustee if no suitable family guardians

4. Guardian Network Development

 Create simplified "Bitcoin inheritance guide" for potential guardians
 Set up view-only wallets for interested family members to build familiarity
 Consider time-locked transactions for inheritance planning
 Organize quarterly "crypto literacy" sessions with small incentives (sats rewards)

Long-term Actions (6-12 Months)
5. Quantum-Resistance Migration

 Monitor Bitcoin quantum-resistance upgrades and consensus
 Plan migration strategy to post-quantum addresses when available
 Keep 20% in newer address formats as they emerge
 Maintain cold storage for long-term holdings, hot wallet for active use

6. Legal & Estate Planning

 Draft crypto-specific will addendum with clear instructions
 Consider crypto-aware estate attorney or service (Casa, Unchained Capital)
 Create "Letter of Instruction" with wallet locations (not seeds)
 Set up dead man's switch system (automated emails/notifications)

Ongoing Practices
7. Regular Maintenance

 Monthly: Check wallet software updates
 Quarterly: Verify backup integrity, test small recovery
 Semi-annually: Review and rotate hot wallet addresses
 Annually: Full security audit and guardian education refresh

8. Risk Distribution Strategy

 Never keep more than 25% in any single wallet type
 Maintain 5-10% in easily accessible hot wallet
 Use hardware wallets from different manufacturers
 Consider institutional custody for a portion (for estate simplicity)

9. Traffic Incident Specific Plan

 Carry only minimal crypto on mobile devices
 Use password manager with emergency access feature
 Create medical directive card mentioning digital asset executor
 Share time-delayed recovery information with trusted contact

10. Building Guardian Capability

 Start with gift wallets (small amounts) to build interest
 Use real-world analogies (digital gold, internet money)
 Focus on one tech-comfortable person as primary backup
 Consider professional custody service as ultimate fallback

Priority Matrix
Critical & Urgent: Items 1, 2, 9
Critical & Not Urgent: Items 3, 4, 6
Important & Not Urgent: Items 5, 7, 8, 10
Remember: Perfect security with zero recoverability is worse than good security with robust recovery options. The goal is resilience, not just protection.
