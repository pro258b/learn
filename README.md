# My Bitcoin/Crypto Risks

## Portfolio Diversity

This is almost a false concept - so far the most diversifield and robust network is Bitcoin, if it fails - it's unlikely a good news for its' competitors or 'next bitcoin'

That said, I will have small exposures to (mostly non-EVM) some potentially interesting things such as:
Ton - because of Telegram - the largest eco-system
UNI - argubly the most used infrastructure in 'crypto'
lightening network/cashu/fedimint - these are networks, not tokens

some airdrop projects - to have some fun in gambling, such as POLYMARKET


## Risk
1. traffic incident
2. dated wallet (for example sollet) with internal leaking
3. hardware recovering failure - because of not validating a backup
4. address format too old, or used bitcoin address - not quantum safe
5. hardware wallet compromising
6. flood

## Mitigation

I have been involving people of vastly different age group (from teens to 50s), trying to get them more engaged. A few did start to read, or use fiat to convert a little bit, but almost none of them are willing to do self-custody.
Teens are mostly not interested in boring 'bitcoin' or 'crypto'
Therefore they won't be good guardians
