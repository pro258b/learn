# My Bitcoin/Crypto Risks

## Portfolio Diversity

This is almost a false concept - so far in this social experiment, the most diversifield and robust network is Bitcoin, if it fails - won't be good news for its' competitors or 'next bitcoin'

That said, I will have small exposures to (mostly non-EVM) some potentially interesting things such as:
Ton - because of Telegram - the largest eco-system
UNI - argubly the most used infrastructure in 'crypto'
lightening network/cashu/fedimint - these are networks, not tokens

some airdrop projects - to have some fun in gambling, such as POLYMARKET


## Risk
1. traffic incident
2. dated wallet (for example sollet) with internal leaking
3. hardware recovering failure - because of not validating a backup
4. address format too old, or used bitcoin address - not quantum safe
5. hardware wallet compromising
6. flood
7. price risk (hedge through option?)

## risk for en mass
Old money trying to reign bitcoin and get bitten hard by its internal volatility, market crash
national state confiscate?

## Mitigation

I have been involving people of vastly different age group (from teens to 50s), trying to get them more engaged. A few did start to read, or use fiat to convert a little bit, but almost none of them are willing to do self-custody.
Teens are mostly not interested in boring 'bitcoin' or 'crypto'
Therefore they won't be good guardians

## ideology for successors:
born between Alpha Go era and GPT era: 'you should follow instruction of the machine' -> "you need to know why the machine ask you to do this" with implicit 'if you want to disobey'
born after GPT era: Delayed satisfaction is important.  ?maybe punctuality is a Prussan style thing that not suit future well?

entropy (Somethings can't be modified/undo)
violence-initiating is not nice (non violence conflict should have a non-violence solution?)

practice: not consumerism;
Own Your Data and Decisions
punctuality being a “Prussian-style thing” not suited for the future?
Async Collaboration: Use tools like smart contracts or X for global, time-zone-agnostic coordination.
Example: A DAO vote may have a 7-day window, prioritizing participation over exact timing, unlike industrial-era punctuality.





## to design a action plan, we need below principle:

What would someone need to recover your assets?
What's the minimum viable knowledge they'd need?
How can we make this foolproof?

## action plan

Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. Security Audit & Updates

 Review all wallet software versions, migrate from any dated wallets (especially Sollet)
 Test all hardware wallet backups with small amounts first
 Document wallet addresses and verify they use modern formats (native SegWit or Taproot)
 Create encrypted digital backups of seed phrases using Shamir's Secret Sharing

2. Physical Security

 Purchase fireproof/waterproof safe or capsule for seed storage
 Identify 2-3 geographically distributed backup locations (safety deposit boxes, trusted locations)
 Create laminated backup cards with recovery instructions
 Consider metal seed phrase backup (steel plates/capsules)

Medium-term Actions (3-6 Months)
3. Multi-signature Setup

 Implement 2-of-3 multisig for majority holdings (you + 2 trusted entities/devices)
 Test recovery process quarterly with small test transactions
 Document the complete recovery process in simple language
 Store one key with legal/professional trustee if no suitable family guardians

4. Guardian Network Development

 Create simplified "Bitcoin inheritance guide" for potential guardians
 Set up view-only wallets for interested family members to build familiarity
 Consider time-locked transactions for inheritance planning
 Organize quarterly "crypto literacy" sessions with small incentives (sats rewards)

Long-term Actions (6-12 Months)
5. Quantum-Resistance Migration

 Monitor Bitcoin quantum-resistance upgrades and consensus
 Plan migration strategy to post-quantum addresses when available
 Keep 20% in newer address formats as they emerge
 Maintain cold storage for long-term holdings, hot wallet for active use

6. Legal & Estate Planning

 Draft crypto-specific will addendum with clear instructions
 Consider crypto-aware estate attorney or service (Casa, Unchained Capital)
 Create "Letter of Instruction" with wallet locations (not seeds)
 Set up dead man's switch system (automated emails/notifications)

Ongoing Practices
7. Regular Maintenance

 Monthly: Check wallet software updates
 Quarterly: Verify backup integrity, test small recovery
 Semi-annually: Review and rotate hot wallet addresses
 Annually: Full security audit and guardian education refresh

8. Risk Distribution Strategy

 Never keep more than 25% in any single wallet type
 Maintain 5-10% in easily accessible hot wallet
 Use hardware wallets from different manufacturers
 Consider institutional custody for a portion (for estate simplicity)

9. Traffic Incident Specific Plan

 Carry only minimal crypto on mobile devices
 Use password manager with emergency access feature
 Create medical directive card mentioning digital asset executor
 Share time-delayed recovery information with trusted contact

10. Building Guardian Capability

 Start with gift wallets (small amounts) to build interest
 Use real-world analogies (digital gold, internet money)
 Focus on one tech-comfortable person as primary backup
 Consider professional custody service as ultimate fallback

Priority Matrix
Critical & Urgent: Items 1, 2, 9
Critical & Not Urgent: Items 3, 4, 6
Important & Not Urgent: Items 5, 7, 8, 10
Remember: Perfect security with zero recoverability is worse than good security with robust recovery options. The goal is resilience, not just protection.

Action PlanSecure Self-Custody Setup (Priority: Immediate)Upgrade Wallets: Replace outdated wallets (e.g., Sollet) with modern, open-source, non-custodial wallets supporting Bitcoin and non-EVM assets (e.g., Sparrow Wallet for Bitcoin, TON Space for TON). Verify compatibility with Taproot addresses for quantum resistance.
Implement Multisig: Set up a 2-of-3 multisig wallet for Bitcoin holdings using multiple hardware wallets (e.g., Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard). Store each device in a separate, secure location.
Validate Backups: Test seed phrase backups for all wallets at least quarterly. Use metal seed storage (e.g., Billfodl) to protect against physical damage like floods. Store backups in at least two geographically distinct locations (e.g., home safe and a bank safety deposit box).
Schedule: Complete wallet upgrades and multisig setup within 1 month. Conduct first backup validation within 2 weeks.

Mitigate Physical and Environmental Risks (Priority: High)Geographic Redundancy: Store one backup in a secure, flood-resistant location outside the primary residence (e.g., a trusted family member’s home in a different city or a bank vault). Ensure the location is accessible but secure.
Disaster Recovery Plan: Create a written recovery plan detailing wallet access, seed phrase locations, and emergency contacts. Share encrypted instructions with a trusted lawyer or use a dead-man’s switch service (e.g., Safe Haven) to ensure access in case of a traffic incident or incapacitation.
Schedule: Establish offsite backup and recovery plan within 2 months.

Enhance Hardware Wallet Security (Priority: High)Multiple Devices: Purchase at least two additional hardware wallets from different manufacturers to reduce single-point-of-failure risks. Initialize and test them within 1 month.
Secure Storage: Store hardware wallets in tamper-evident bags and use passphrases for an additional layer of security. Keep passphrases separate from seed phrases and memorize critical ones.
Regular Audits: Check hardware wallets for signs of tampering every 6 months. Update firmware promptly to address vulnerabilities.
Schedule: Acquire additional hardware wallets within 1 month; set up passphrases and audit schedule immediately.

Portfolio Management (Priority: Medium)Bitcoin Core: Allocate at least 80% of the portfolio to Bitcoin, held in the multisig setup. Use Lightning Network wallets (e.g., Phoenix, Muun) for small, frequent transactions to leverage layer-2 efficiency.
Non-EVM and Airdrop Positions: Limit speculative holdings (TON, UNI, Polymarket, etc.) to 10-15% of the portfolio. Store these in separate, secure wallets and review their performance quarterly. Exit any airdrop project showing no traction after 6 months.
Cashu/Fedimint Exploration: Experiment with Cashu or Fedimint for private, community-based Bitcoin transactions. Join a trusted Fedimint federation or test Cashu for small-scale use within 3 months.
Schedule: Review portfolio allocation monthly; set up Cashu/Fedimint test within 3 months.

Address Quantum Risk (Priority: Medium)Adopt Taproot: Transition Bitcoin holdings to Taproot addresses (BIP-86) for improved privacy and potential quantum resistance. Use wallets like Sparrow or BlueWallet that support Taproot.
Monitor Quantum Developments: Follow updates from Bitcoin Core developers and quantum computing research to stay informed about future risks. Reassess address formats annually.
Schedule: Complete transition to Taproot addresses within 3 months; schedule annual quantum risk review.

Engage Others Without Reliance (Priority: Low)Educational Resources: Share beginner-friendly resources (e.g., “The Bitcoin Standard” audiobook, short YouTube explainers) with teens and others to spark interest in Bitcoin. Avoid pushing self-custody until they show initiative.
Incentives: Offer small Bitcoin rewards (e.g., 1,000 sats via Lightning) for completing educational tasks, but don’t rely on them as guardians.
Alternative Guardians: Identify 1-2 trusted adults (e.g., in their 30s or 40s) with technical interest to act as emergency contacts for recovery plans, rather than teens. Share encrypted recovery instructions with them.
Schedule: Distribute educational resources within 1 month; identify potential guardians within 2 months.

Continuous Monitoring and Improvement (Priority: Ongoing)Security Updates: Subscribe to security alerts from wallet providers and Bitcoin news sources (e.g., Bitcoin Magazine, X posts from @Bitcoin
). Check for updates monthly.
Community Engagement: Join Bitcoin-focused communities on X or forums like BitcoinTalk to stay updated on best practices and emerging risks.
Annual Review: Conduct a full review of wallets, backups, and portfolio allocation every 12 months to ensure alignment with goals and security standards.
